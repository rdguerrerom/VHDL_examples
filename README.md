VHDL (VHSIC-HDL, Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language) is a hardware description language 
used in electronic design automation to describe digital and mixed-signal systems such as field-programmable gate arrays 
and integrated circuits. VHDL can also be used as a general-purpose parallel programming language.

This repository is collection of interesting examples to learn the best-practices and patterns for VHDL
